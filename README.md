# Parking-Management-System-Prototype

## Description:
As a developer, your task is to prototype a parking management system that allows users to check the availability of parking spots based on vehicle size. The system should provide an interface for users to query if there is enough space for their vehicles.

## Requirements:
### 1. Parking Spot Management:
Design a data structure to represent parking spots, including their unique identifiers and occupancy status.
Implement functions to add and remove parking spots from the system.
Ensure that the system can handle different types of parking spots (e.g., compact, regular, large) with varying occupancy limits.

### 2. Vehicle Size Acceptance:
Design a mechanism to accept vehicle size information (e.g., compact, regular, large) from users.
Implement a function that checks if a parking spot can accommodate a given vehicle size based on its occupancy status.

### 3. User Query:
Develop a user interface that allows users to input their vehicle size and query the system for available parking spots.
Display the available parking spots to the user based on their vehicle size.

### 4. Error Handling:
Implement appropriate error handling mechanisms to handle scenarios such as invalid inputs, exceeding occupancy limits, or querying unavailable parking spots.

### 5. Documentation and Testing:
Provide clear and concise documentation on how to use the parking management system.
Write unit tests to verify the correctness of your implementation.

### Guidelines:
You are free to choose any programming language and framework to develop the prototype.
Focus on writing clean, maintainable, and well-structured code.
Pay attention to code efficiency and scalability.
You can assume that the prototype will be used in a single parking lot.

### Submission:
Provide the source code of your implementation along with any necessary instructions to run the prototype.
Include a README file explaining your design choices, assumptions, and any additional information you think is relevant.
